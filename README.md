# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This program implements a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. Players take turns placing their markers (`X` or `O`) on a 3x3 grid. The game determines the winner or declares a draw when no valid moves are left. Players can also choose to play multiple rounds, and the program keeps track of the scores.

## How to Play

1. The game starts by displaying the initial board with numbers (1â€“9) representing positions.
2. Player `X` begins the game.
3. Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the position where they want to place their marker.
4. The program checks for the following conditions after each move:
   - **Win**: If a player aligns three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal, they win.
   - **Draw**: If all spots are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
5. After the game ends, players can press `y` to start a new game or any other key to exit.
